- 🐳 **dockeriser** $\textsf{\color{gray} (coming soon)}$ - Proof-of-concept container runtime in 150 lines of Python, adapted from Go concepts


## Languages & Focus

**Primary:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**Learning:** C++ for systems programming  
**Interests:** Async networking, containerization, key-value stores, process management

## Philosophy

Build functional proof-of-concepts that demonstrate core system concepts. Translate ideas across languages. Ship working code, learn by doing, optimize when necessary.

Most projects start as "I wonder how X works" and end up as minimal implementations that actually work.
