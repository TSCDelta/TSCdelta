## Hi there 👋

# TSCdelta

Systems programmer who builds things to understand how they work.

## Projects

- 🔴 **redis-mini** - Lightweight Redis implementation with asyncio, TTL support, AOF persistence, and batch operations (GET, SET, DEL, MGET, MSET, FLUSH) $\textsf{\color{orange} (currently building)}$
- 🎯 **kando** - Kanban board made with Firebase, Next.js, and SocketIO $\textsf{\color{orange} (currently building)}$ 
- 🐳 **dockeriser** $\textsf{\color{gray} (coming soon)}$ - Proof-of-concept container runtime in 150 lines of Python, adapted from Go concepts
- ⚖️ **load-balancer** $\textsf{\color{gray} (coming soon)}$ - HTTP load balancer built with aiohttp for distributing requests across multiple backend servers
- 💥 **88-Chip** $\textsf{\color{gray} (coming soon)}$ - Chip 8 emulator built in pygame

## Languages & Focus

**Primary:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**Learning:** C++ for systems programming  
**Interests:** Async networking, containerization, key-value stores, process management

## Philosophy

Build functional proof-of-concepts that demonstrate core system concepts. Translate ideas across languages. Ship working code, learn by doing, optimize when necessary.

Most projects start as "I wonder how X works" and end up as minimal implementations that actually work.
