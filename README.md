## Hi there 👋

# TSCdelta (Tanzim Chowdhury)

Student interested in Systems Programming. Building things to learn how they work.

## Projects

- 🎌 **animestream** - MyAnimeList clone built with React/Express using Jikan API for anime data and user list management $\textsf{\color{green} (done)}$
- ⚖️ **load-balancer** - HTTP load balancer built with aiohttp for distributing requests across multiple backend servers $\textsf{\color{green} (done)}$
- 🔴 **redis-mini** - Lightweight Redis implementation with asyncio, TTL support, AOF persistence, and batch operations (GET, SET, DEL, MGET, MSET, FLUSH) $\textsf{\color{orange} (currently building)}$ (Parser, Deparser, Server-Client done)
- 💥 **88-Chip** - Chip 8 emulator built in pygame $\textsf{\color{orange} (currently building)}$ (CPU done)
- 🐳 **dockeriser** $\textsf{\color{gray} (coming soon)}$ - Proof-of-concept container runtime in 150 lines of Python, adapted from Go concepts


## Languages & Focus

**Primary:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript  
**Learning:** C++ for systems programming  
**Interests:** Async networking, containerization, key-value stores, process management

## Philosophy

Build functional proof-of-concepts that demonstrate core system concepts. Translate ideas across languages. Ship working code, learn by doing, optimize when necessary.

Most projects start as "I wonder how X works" and end up as minimal implementations that actually work.
